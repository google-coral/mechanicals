# AIY Maker Kit 3D-printable case

This case holds a Raspberry Pi 4 with a Coral USB Accelerator and Pi Camera.
For details, see aiyprojects.withgoogle.com/maker/.

All parts can be printed without supports. We recommend printing with PLA filament
for the best snap-fit.

The standard 2-part case requires the following parts:
	1. Maker_Kit_case_base.stl
	2. Maker_Kit_case_top.stl

If you want the GPIO header exposed, instead print
Maker_Kit_case_top_with_GPIO_cutout.stl.

If you want to reposition the camera, also print Maker_Kit_camera_case.stl,
which can snap onto the case base or top in different orientations by
printing the base/top variants with "camera_case_plugs."
