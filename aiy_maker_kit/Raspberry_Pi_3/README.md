# AIY Maker Kit 3D-printable case for Raspberry Pi 3

To create the basic 2-piece case, print these two parts:

+ Maker_Kit_Pi3_case_base.stl
+ Maker_Kit_Pi3_case_top.stl

If you want the GPIO header exposed, instead print
Maker_Kit_Pi3_case_top_with_GPIO_cutout.stl.

If you want to reposition the camera, also print Maker_Kit_camera_case.stl,
which can snap onto the case base or top in different orientations by
printing the base/top variants with "camera_case_plugs."

All parts can be printed without supports.

We recommend printing with PLA filament for the best snap-fit.
